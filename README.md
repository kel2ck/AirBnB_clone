AIRBNB CLONE TEAM PROJECT

Project Description:

The Airbnb clone project for which we are tasked to create a copy of the Airbnb.
 
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python.

Command Interpreter
Description

The Command Interpreter is used to manage the whole application's functionality from the command line, such as:

Crete a new object.
Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
Execute operation on objects. e.g. Count, compute statistics, etc.
Update object's attributes.
Destroy an object.

Usage:

It can work in two different modes:

Interactive and Non-interactive.

In Interactive mode, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command.

To launch the console application in interactive mode simply run:

console.py 

In Non-interactive mode, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.

To launch the console application in non-interactive mode simply run:

echo "user's-command" | ./console.py
